# TDD-First FastAPI Microservice Development

Orchestrates TDD-focused FastAPI microservice development using Clean Architecture principles with comprehensive testing strategy and domain-informed TDD cycles.

## Workflow Overview

This command executes a specialized TDD-first development workflow designed for FastAPI microservices, emphasizing:
- **Domain-informed TDD**: Red-Green-Refactor cycles with business domain understanding
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper layer separation (Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Presentation)
- **Given-When-Then Testing**: BDD-structured test cases across all layers
- **Mock-First Strategy**: Comprehensive external dependency mocking (no real I/O in tests)
- **Poetry + pytest Integration**: Modern Python tooling with proper dependency management

## Agent Coordination

### Phase 1: TDD Architecture Planning
- **@tdd-coordinator**: Establishes TDD workflow protocols and test execution strategy
- **@qa-agent**: Designs comprehensive testing architecture with Given-When-Then structure
- **@code-architect**: Plans Clean Architecture scaffold with TDD-compatible interfaces
- **Human Checkpoint**: Review TDD approach and approve testing strategy

### Phase 2: Red Phase Execution (Failing Tests)
- **@tdd-coordinator**: Orchestrates failing test generation and validates proper failure reasons
- **@qa-agent**: Generates Given-When-Then structured tests for all functionality layers
- **@code-architect**: Creates minimal interface definitions to enable test compilation
- **Human Checkpoint**: Review test coverage and Given-When-Then structure

### Phase 3: Green Phase Execution (Minimal Implementation)  
- **@tdd-coordinator**: Validates minimal implementation approach and test passage
- **@code-architect**: Implements just enough code to make tests pass (no over-engineering)
- **@qa-agent**: Validates test passage and mock integration
- **Human Checkpoint**: Review implementation minimalism and architecture adherence

### Phase 4: Refactor Phase Execution (Clean Architecture)
- **@tdd-coordinator**: Guides refactoring while maintaining test passage
- **@code-architect**: Refactors for Clean Architecture compliance and SOLID principles
- **@qa-agent**: Validates continued test passage and quality improvements
- **Human Checkpoint**: Final review of Clean Architecture implementation and TDD adherence

## Technical Stack

## TDD Cycle Example

### Red Phase: Failing Test Generation
```python
def test_create_user_endpoint():
    # Given: Valid user data and mocked service
    user_data = {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}
    expected_user = {"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}
    mock_user_service.create_user.return_value = expected_user
    
    # When: POST request to create user
    response = client.post("/users", json=user_data)
    
    # Then: User created successfully
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json() == expected_user
    mock_user_service.create_user.assert_called_once_with(user_data)
```

### Green Phase: Minimal Implementation
```python
@router.post("/", status_code=201)
async def create_user(
    request: CreateUserRequest,
    user_service: UserServiceInterface = Depends(get_user_service)
):
    user = await user_service.create_user(request.dict())
    return user
```

### Refactor Phase: Clean Architecture Enhancement
- Extract domain validation logic
- Implement proper dependency injection
- Add error handling with HTTPException mapping
- Optimize async patterns and response models

## Quality Gates

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- Domain logic: Minimum 95% coverage
- Application services: Minimum 90% coverage  
- Infrastructure adapters: Minimum 85% coverage
- Presentation layer: Minimum 80% coverage

**TDD Compliance Validation**:
- All functionality implemented through Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- Given-When-Then structure in all test cases
- Complete external dependency mocking (no real I/O)
- Clean Architecture layer separation maintained

**Performance Benchmarks**:
- Full test suite execution: Under 30 seconds
- Individual test isolation: Each test runs independently
- FastAPI startup time: Under 2 seconds
- API response times: Under 200ms for standard operations

## Human Checkpoints

**Checkpoint 1: TDD Strategy Approval**
- Review proposed testing architecture and Given-When-Then structure
- Approve external dependency mocking strategy
- Validate Clean Architecture layer planning

**Checkpoint 2: Red Phase Validation**  
- Review failing test coverage and structure
- Confirm Given-When-Then implementation quality
- Approve test isolation and mock setup

**Checkpoint 3: Green Phase Review**
- Validate minimal implementation approach (no over-engineering)
- Review test passage and FastAPI endpoint functionality  
- Confirm mock integration and async pattern usage

**Checkpoint 4: Refactor Phase Approval**
- Review Clean Architecture compliance and SOLID principle adherence
- Validate continued test passage during refactoring
- Approve final implementation quality and documentation

## Usage

/project:tdd-microservice "Create a user management microservice with CRUD operations, email validation, and external notification integration"
```

This command will guide you through TDD-first development with proper agent coordination, human checkpoints, and comprehensive quality validation.

## Integration with Full Workflow

This command represents a specialized Phase 3 implementation for the `/project:full-workflow` command, focusing specifically on TDD-disciplined execution when microservice development is the chosen implementation approach.

Can be used:
- **Standalone**: For focused FastAPI microservice development with TDD discipline
- **Integrated**: As the execution phase within the broader 4-phase development workflow
