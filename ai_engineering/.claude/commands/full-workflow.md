# Sequential Multi-Agent Development Workflow with Mandatory Approval Gates

## üõë MANDATORY AGENT VALIDATION PROTOCOL

### Before EVERY Agent Execution:
```
ü§ñ AGENT REQUEST
================
Agent: [agent-type]
Task: [description]
Purpose: [what we're achieving]

‚û°Ô∏è Approve this agent? (yes/no)
```

**I MUST**:
1. STOP and present the above request
2. WAIT for explicit approval (yes/proceed/go ahead)
3. ABORT if user says no or provides different instructions

### After EVERY Agent Completion:

**I MUST**:
1. DISPLAY the FULL agent output (no summarization)
2. WAIT for user to review all options/recommendations
3. ASK: "‚û°Ô∏è How would you like to proceed?"
4. ONLY continue after user provides direction

**CRITICAL**: 
- NEVER summarize agent outputs
- ALWAYS show complete results including all options
- Let USER choose from agent-provided options

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES
1. **STRICTLY SEQUENTIAL**: Each step MUST complete before the next begins
2. **MANDATORY APPROVAL**: Human approval is REQUIRED at every checkpoint - no skipping
3. **STATE TRACKING**: System must maintain execution state and prevent out-of-order execution
4. **BLOCKING GATES**: Workflow halts completely until approval is received
5. **NO PARALLEL AGENTS**: One agent at a time only
6. **FULL OUTPUT DISPLAY**: Never summarize agent results - show everything

## Workflow State Management
```yaml
workflow_state:
  current_phase: [1|2|3|4]
  current_step: string
  completed_steps: []
  pending_approval: boolean
  approval_history: []
  blocked_reason: string
```

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. State Validation Function
```python
def validate_next_step(current_state, requested_step):
    """
    Prevents out-of-order execution
    """
    if not is_prerequisite_met(current_state, requested_step):
        raise BlockedExecutionError(
            f"Cannot execute {requested_step}. "
            f"Waiting for: {get_blocking_approval(current_state)}"
        )
```

### 2. Approval Tracking
```python
approval_log = {
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "gate_id": "H0_REQ",
    "decision": "APPROVE|REJECT|REVISE",
    "approver": "user_id",
    "comments": "string",
    "artifacts_reviewed": []
}
```

### 3. Rollback Prevention
```yaml
rules:
  - Once approved, a gate cannot be "un-approved"
  - To change, must restart from that point
  - All downstream work is invalidated on rollback
```

## Usage Commands

### Start Workflow (Sequential Only)
```bash
/workflow:start --mode=sequential --project="Customer Sentiment Analysis"
```

### Check Current State
```bash
/workflow:status
# Returns: Current phase, step, and pending approval
```

### Submit Approval
```bash
/workflow:approve --gate=H0_REQ --decision=APPROVE --comment="Requirements look good"
```

### Force Sequential Re-check
```bash
/workflow:validate --enforce-sequential
```

---

## Error States

### Blocked Execution
```
ERROR: Cannot proceed to Step 2.3 (ML Architecture)
REASON: Pending approval at Gate H2_DATA
ACTION: Submit approval for H2_DATA before continuing
```

### Out-of-Order Attempt
```
ERROR: Attempted to execute Phase 3 while in Phase 2
REASON: Sequential execution enforced
ACTION: Complete all Phase 2 steps and approvals first
```

### Stale State
```
WARNING: Approval H2_ARCH invalidated due to upstream change
REASON: H1 was revised after H2_ARCH approval
ACTION: Re-approve H2_ARCH with updated context
```
