# Claude Code Multi-Agent System - Usage Examples

## üìã Copy to New Project (Quick Start)

To use this system in a new project:
```bash
# Copy the essential .claude directory (contains all subagents)
cp -r .claude/ your-new-project/
cp USAGE_EXAMPLES.md your-new-project/

# Start using immediately with native Claude Code subagents
cd your-new-project
claude "Build a customer sentiment analysis API"  # Auto-delegates to appropriate agents
claude "@brainstormer: Generate 3 solution approaches for real-time processing"
```
See `TEMPLATE_SETUP.md` for details.

## ‚úÖ Setup Complete!

Your Multi-Agent AI Development System uses **native Claude Code subagents** with automatic delegation and **human checkpoint validation**. Claude Code will intelligently route tasks to the most appropriate specialized agent based on your request, while automatically requesting human approval for resource-intensive operations.

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Native Subagent Delegation with Checkpoint Protection** 
Claude Code automatically delegates tasks to specialized agents based on:
- Task description analysis and context understanding  
- Agent capability matching and expertise alignment
- Automatic routing without manual intervention required
- **Human checkpoint validation** for resource-intensive operations (ML training, data processing, destructive commands)

### 2. **Two Primary Usage Modes**

#### A. **Automatic Delegation with Checkpoints** (Recommended)
```bash
# Claude Code automatically selects the best agent and validates resource usage
claude "I need to build a customer sentiment analysis API"
# ‚Üí Auto-delegates through multiple agents for complete development
# ‚Üí Requests approval for ML model training or data processing steps

claude "Generate test cases for this user authentication endpoint"  
# ‚Üí Auto-delegates to @qa-agent (proceeds automatically for safe operations)

claude "What's the best architecture for processing 1M requests/day?"
# ‚Üí Auto-delegates to @brainstormer and @system-designer
# ‚Üí May request approval for external research or resource-intensive analysis
```

#### B. **Explicit Agent Invocation**
```bash
# Directly invoke specific agents using @ syntax
claude "@system-designer: Design Clean Architecture for microservices"
claude "@data-scientist: Analyze customer behavior patterns in this dataset" 
claude "@code-architect: Generate user service with Clean Architecture principles"
```

#### C. **Complete Workflow Commands**
```bash
# Use the full workflow slash command for complex projects
claude "/project:full-workflow Create a real-time recommendation engine with ML pipeline"
# ‚Üí Orchestrates all 4 phases with proper agent handoffs and human checkpoints

# Use TDD-focused workflow for FastAPI microservices
claude "/project:tdd-microservice Create a user management service with authentication and CRUD"
# ‚Üí TDD-first development with Given-When-Then testing and Clean Architecture
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Dual Human Validation System

The system provides **two layers of validation** for comprehensive workflow control:

### **1. Operation Checkpoints (PreToolUse Hook)**
Validates operations BEFORE execution:

```bash
# ML/Data Science operations
claude "Train a sentiment analysis model on 50GB of tweets"
# ‚Üí üî¨ ML Operation Checkpoint: Approve GPU usage? [Y/N]

claude "@model-engineer: Fine-tune BERT on customer feedback" 
# ‚Üí üî¨ Model Training Checkpoint: Confirm resource allocation [Y/N]

# Destructive operations  
claude "Delete all test databases and reset environment"
# ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Destructive Operation: Confirm deletion of test databases [Y/N]

# Package installations
claude "Install tensorflow and pytorch for model comparison"
# ‚Üí üì¶ Package Installation: Approve dependency changes [Y/N]
```

### **2. Output Validation (PostTask Hook)**
Reviews agent deliverables AFTER completion:

```bash
claude "@brainstormer: Design payment processing system"
# Agent completes task...
# ‚Üí üîç HUMAN VALIDATION REQUIRED
#    Agent: brainstormer
#    Phase: Phase 1: Initial Scoping
#    Review output quality [Approve/Revise/Stop/Details]: _

claude "@code-architect: Generate authentication microservice"
# Agent generates code...
# ‚Üí üîç VALIDATION CHECKPOINT
#    Agent: code-architect  
#    Phase: Phase 3: Execution
#    Validate code quality [A/R/S/D]: _
```

### **Combined Validation Flow Example:**
```bash
claude "Build fraud detection system with ML"
# Step 1: Brainstormer generates approaches
# ‚Üí Output Validation: Review approaches [A/R/S/D]
# Step 2: Data Scientist starts EDA
# ‚Üí Operation Checkpoint: Approve data processing [Y/N]
# ‚Üí Output Validation: Review EDA results [A/R/S/D]
# Step 3: Model Engineer trains model
# ‚Üí Operation Checkpoint: Approve GPU training [Y/N]
# ‚Üí Output Validation: Review model architecture [A/R/S/D]
```

```

## üéâ You're Ready!

Your Claude Code Multi-Agent System with dual validation is fully operational:

### What You Can Do:
1. **Automatic routing** - Claude intelligently delegates to specialized agents
2. **Direct agent calls** - Use `@agent:` syntax for specific expertise  
3. **Complete workflows** - Run `/project:full-workflow` for end-to-end development
4. **TDD development** - Use `/project:tdd-microservice` for test-driven APIs

### Validation Layers Active:
- **Pre-execution safety** - Operation checkpoints prevent costly mistakes
- **Post-execution quality** - Output validation ensures deliverable standards
- **Interactive control** - Approve/Revise/Stop/Details at every checkpoint
- **Phase alignment** - Validations map to workflow diagram points (H0-H7)

### Development Process:
The system follows the 4-phase workflow with comprehensive validation:
- **Phase 1**: Initial Scoping (validated requirements & approaches)
- **Phase 2**: System Design (approved architecture & resources)
- **Phase 3**: Execution (quality-assured implementation)
- **Phase 4**: Monitoring (optimized performance)

Every agent output is validated, every expensive operation is confirmed, ensuring both **quality** and **cost control** throughout your development process.
